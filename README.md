# Mersenne Prime Search

My attempt to generate and verify arbitrarily large Mersenne primes.

<h4> Current largest: </h4>

> M(110503) == 2^110503 - 1 with 25962 digits (Pure Python3)

> In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2n − 1 for some integer n. They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century.

<h4> How to Run </h4>

+ `git clone https://github.com/vishnuvardhan-kumar/mersenne-prime-search.git`

+  `cd mersenne-prime-search`
 
+  `python mersenne.py`

<h4> Project Roadmap </h4>

+ Move from Python3 to C/C++ (using a library such as GMP)
+ Parellize operations on threads/microthreads
+ Implement prime exponent paradigm
